 There are three kinds of agents – PurchaserAgent, SellerAgent and
FacilitatorAgent. 
    The SellerAgent provides the function of registering goods for an
auction to the sellers.
    The second agent is the PurchaserAgent that requires bidding
to buy and it suggests a proper bidding price by analyzing the bidding history of the
bidding competitor. 
    The third agent is the FacilitatorAgent that plays the role of an
auctioneer and enables a bidder to look at the other person’s auction history while
bidding for and buying a product.
